### Required Software
It is possible to get up and running with a Jekyll Academic website using only your web browser and a GitHub account. Full documentation for **local installation and editing** can be found on the [Documentation ](documentation/) page.

### QuickStart
This QuickStart guide is geared to getting you up and running quickly, using only a web browser and GitHub account. Following the directions below will result in you having a Jekyll Academic website hosted on GitHub pages live on the web. Before you begin working through the QuickStart guide you may want to familiarize yourself with the following technologies that will be used to create your Jekyll Academic website:

* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/Markdown/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
****

_Skip this step if you have already setup your GitHub account_

* In a web browser, navigate to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/)
* Fill Out Username*, Email Address and Password
* Click Sign up for GitHub button
* Click the Finish Sign Up button

\*Make a note of the username that you create, as you will be required to use it in setting up your GitHub pages repository.

#### 2) Verify Email Address
* Navigate to the email account you used to sign up
* Verify your email address by clicking on the “Verify email address” button in the email you received from GitHub

* Click on Begin Import
* Once import is complete navigate to [username.github.io] in your web browser

\*Note: For for GitHub Pages site to work correctly, the repository name must exactly match the format of [username].github.io. For example if your GitHub username is student1234 your GitHub Pages repository must be named student1234.github.io

#### 4) See your Live Website
* Open your web browser and go to [username].github.io

#### 5) Edit Site Files via GitHub Browser Editor
* Open a second web browser tab that shows the files in your repository github.com/[username]/[username].github.io
* Edit the main settings file for your website to add your name, and to link your accounts
* Click on the  \_config.yml file in your repository to see the contents of that file
* Click on the ‘Edit This File’ button
* Edit the following entries of the \_config.yml file
    * Title
    * Name
    * Bio
    * Email (enter your full email address)
* Edit the following entries to provide links to social media platforms by replacing `#username` with your actual username on that platform.
    * Twitter
    * Facebook
    * GitHub
    * ... etc.

#### 6) Commit Changes to GitHub*
* After making changes to the file, make a note under the ‘Commit Changes’ section documenting the changes that you made (e.g. Updated social media usernames)
* Click ‘Commit changes’
* Refresh the browser tab that contains your live website ([username].github.io) and confirm that changes were made to your site
